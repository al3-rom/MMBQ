MMBQ ‚Äî Website Concept for a Mobile Operator
Just finished a new concept project: a modern and responsive website for MMBQ, a fictional mobile online operator based in Bogot√°.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech stack:

Astro, TailwindCSS, and a bit of Vue.js for interactive features

Dark and light theme support

Fully responsive and mobile-first

Multilingual: available in English and Spanish

The goal was to create a sleek and user-friendly interface for a telecom service ‚Äî with modern UI, clear structure, and scalable architecture.

This project helped me improve my frontend workflow and gain hands-on experience with internationalization (i18n) and theme toggling.
